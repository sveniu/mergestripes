mergestripes - a simple stripe merger

Open N input files, read stripes of size S from each input file in
order, and sequentially write each stripe to the output file.

Usage: ./mergestripes [-s stripe_size] outfile infile infile [infile...]

Default stripe size is 512 bytes.

Prompted by a manual RAID recovery, I needed a simple tool to merge
together stripes of a RAID-0 array after having imaged the harddrives
to a larger disk.

The RAID was a LaCie 4big Quadra, which oddly uses a 512-byte stripe
size and no meta data (at least in the beginning of the disks; there
seems to be some data at the very end of each disk). The lack of
metadata actually made the recovery fairly simple.

Performance is absolutely excellent (hundreds of MB/sec) due to the
behind-the-scenes buffering done by fread/fwrite. This makes it
unnecessary to read/write larger blocks while doing small-stripe
merging in memory.
